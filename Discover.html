                            The striking landscapes of Fjord Norway were created by a succession of ice ages, and the characteristic landscape hasn‚Äôt changed a great deal since people started living here. Fjord arms and waterfalls are accessible virtually everywhere you go, and UNESCO has included the west Norwegian fjord landscape, exemplified by the Geirangerfjord and the N√¶r√∏yfjord, on its prestigious World Heritage List.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In Fjord Norway you‚Äôll find everything from solitary islands to some of Norway‚Äôs largest cities. A short drive is all it takes to go from urban life to quiet countryside or prime wilderness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along every fjord, you will find small communities and villages with their own culinary specialities. The local traditions reflect what was possible to grow in each place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many of the region‚Äôs fertile valleys are ideal for growing fruit, and apples, pears, cherries, and strawberries are popular and common crops. Wild game, fish, or locally reared sheep form the base of many a special dish from Fjord Norway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tourists all over the world have Fjord Norway on their wish list, and for a good reason. If you prefer to visit the region and its many attractions without the crowds, be sure to go in autumn, winter or spring during the so-called Viking season.

                        Combine cool city culture with wildlife experiences in raw nature. In a surprisingly short time you can get from charming coastal towns in the Oslo region via huge forests populated by moose to Norway‚Äôs absolute highest and mightiest mountains in the Jotunheimen national park, where you can even walk on smaller glaciers ‚Äì on guided trips, of course.

                    <p>
                        Many kickstart their holiday in the capital of Oslo, which is also the country‚Äôs main hub for international and domestic travel. The urban vibe is boosted by new architecture, exciting food, and a lively music and art scene. The city is also a good base for day trips around the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though Eastern Norway is by far the country‚Äôs most populated region, there are vast areas of almost untouched nature and plenty of things to do outside. Why not start with compact island hopping, a boat ride on Norway‚Äôs largest lake, or fly-fishing in one of the famous salmon rivers?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The hiking possibilities are endless, with the Besseggen ridge as only one of many popular mountain routes. Cycling enthusiasts can choose between classic tour routes, internationally renowned bike parks, or leisurely biking along national cycle roads. The scenic mountains and valleys of Eastern Norway are perfect for skiing and other winter sports.

                    <p>
                        Visit jaw-dropping mountains like Torghatten in Helgeland (pictured), M√∏ysalen in Vester√•len, or the Lyngen Alps‚Ä¶ and listen to the other-worldly sounds of the joik.

                        You see, this part of Norway is where the majority of the country's indigenous people live ‚Äì the Sami ‚Äì and their ancient song tradition is simply captivating.
                        
                        Their traditional reindeer stew, bidos, is also worth a try if you get the chance.

                    <p>
                        The seafood here is also world-class, and you might get the catch of your life at any time of the year.

However, if you visit between January and April, you can try to reel in a big skrei ‚Äì the migrating Atlantic cod arriving from the Barents Sea.

Or perhaps a king crab safari is more your style?

                    <p>
                        An important thing to remember before you start planning your trip is that Northern Norway is a vast area.

It stretches from the Helgeland region in the south to mainland Europe's northernmost point near the North Cape (pictured) and east towards the Russian border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glittering fjords, staggering peaks and unspoilt nature await.

Have fun at one of the white beaches, check out some of Norway's top kayaking spots, go hiking and even surfing (!) ‚Ä¶<br>‚Ä¶ or embrace the snow and go ski touring or dog sledding in winter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also go on a guided whale safari ‚Ä¶ and join a rib tour or a boat trip to one of the world's strongest maelstroms, Saltstraumen outside the lively and cultural city Bod√∏.

                        Or you could just stay. For this is the perfect place to learn how to master the noble art of the Norwegian favourite pastime ‚Äì ‚Äúkos‚Äù.

Time just seems to pass a bit slower here, and many of the locals appear to move at a more laid-back pace. In Tr√∏ndelag, ‚Äúkos‚Äù is just a way of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what is ‚Äúkos‚Äù exactly?

It can be the time you spend with your friends exploring the old wooden neighbourhood of Bakklandet in the pulsating student town of Trondheim. The region‚Äôs main city is the very capital of ‚Äúkos‚Äù.

                    <p>
                        And also of jazz, cool contemporary art and funky festivals, cheesemaking monks and guys with big moustaches called ‚Äútr√∏nderbart‚Äùüë®üèª.

Not to forget some of the most innovative tech-savvy engineers in Europe.

                        The Svalbard Islands are located in the Arctic Ocean, halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Here, you will find untouched arctic wilderness and unique wildlife in a setting that is both rugged and fragile at the same time.
                    </span>
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Svalbard has fascinated travellers for a long time. Rich wildlife, arctic nature, and old mining towns are all found on the islands, which have a stark and eerie beauty that‚Äôs all their own. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to a few thousand polar bears, the islands are home to almost 3,000 human inhabitants, over 2,000 of which live in Longyearbyen, the administrative centre and largest settlement of the islands. This small and colourful community has gone from a typical village town to a modern community with different kinds of businesses and industries, and with a surprisingly wide range of cultural activities and opportunities, such as concerts, shows, festivals and exhibitions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arctic food is served at a wide range of places to eat and drink of higher standards than you might expect from a small community, among them the world's northernmost sushi restaurant. Svalbard also has a local beer brewery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‚ÄúSvalbard‚Äù means ‚Äúcold coasts‚Äù and was first mentioned in Icelandic texts in the 12th century. However, the archipelago has a relatively mild climate compared to other areas at the same latitude. In Longyearbyen, the average temperature ranges from -14¬∞C in winter to 6¬∞C in summer. The most common way to travel to Svalbard is by plane.
