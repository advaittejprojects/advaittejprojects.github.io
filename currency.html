	<h1>Currency</h1>
	<p>Currency: Canadian dollar (CAD) . $,CA$ OR C$ are used to distinguish from the currencies like US$</p>
	<p>Accounting for approximately 2% of all global reserves, the Canadian dollar is the fifth-most held reserve currency in the world, behind the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen and the pound sterling.[3] The Canadian dollar is popular with central banks because of Canada's relative economic soundness, the Canadian government's strong sovereign position, and the stability of the country's legal and political systems.</p>
